      <description>Preamble The objective of this project was to use provide a job description and resume to the OpenAI API. The API would then return a short paragraph stating whether the resume was suitable for the job. To accomplish this, a single webpage was created that makes a request to an AWS Lambda function which processes the request and returns OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s response.
For brevity the code examples that follow will only contain code necessary to explain the concept being discussed.</description>
